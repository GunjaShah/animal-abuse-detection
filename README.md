# Animal Abuse Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect instances of animal abuse in images using the YOLOv8 model. The dataset has been created from scratch to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**: Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. **Obtain Model**: Get access to the trained YOLOv8 model weights.
3. **Detection**: Run the script with input images/videos.
4. **Review**: Check output predictions for signs of animal abuse.

## Future Plans
- **Data Enhancement**: Continuously improve dataset diversity.
- **Optimization**: Speed up inference without losing accuracy.
- **Specialization**: Fine-tune for specific types of abuse or animals.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to suggest enhancements or report issues.
